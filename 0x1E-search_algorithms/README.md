# C - Search Algorithms
This is a directory that contains C programming projects on search algortihm and in this drectory, projects will be done on linear and binary search. Generally on the best search algorithm to use depending on the needs of the project.
Also, projects on big O notations will be worked on.

# Requirements
The following conditions will be considered while working on the projects;
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, … is forbidden.
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
- All your header files should be include guarded

For the Big O notations files, these formats will be used;
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n*m -> O(nm)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
- …
